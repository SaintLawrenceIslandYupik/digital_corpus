1	I witness before God and Christ Jesus, that shall deem the quick and the dead, by the coming of him, and the kingdom of him,
2	preach the word, be thou busy suitably without rest, reprove thou, beseech thou, blame thou in all patience and doctrine. [preach the word, be thou busy to opportune and inopportune, reprove, beseech, blame in all patience and doctrine.]
3	For time shall be, when men shall not suffer wholesome teaching, but at their desires they shall gather together to themselves masters itching to the ears. [Forsooth time shall be, when men shall not sustain whole doctrine, but at their desires, they shall gather together to themselves masters itching, or pleasing, to the ears.]
4	And truly they shall turn away the hearing from truth, but to fables they shall turn. [And truly they shall turn away their hearing from truth, but to fables they shall be turned together.]
5	But wake thou, in all things travail thou, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy service [fulfill thy service, or office], be thou sober.
6	For I am sacrificed now, and the time of my departing is nigh.
7	I have striven a good strife, I have ended the course, I have kept the faith.
8	In the tother time a crown of rightwiseness is kept to me, which the Lord, a just doomsman, shall yield to me in that day; and not only to me, but also to these that love his coming [but to them that love his coming].
9	Hie thou to come to me soon.
10	For Demas, loving this world, hath forsaken me [Forsooth Demas hath forsaken me, loving this world], and went to Thessalonica, Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia;
11	Luke alone is with me.  Take thou Mark [Take Mark], and bring with thee; for he is profitable to me into service.
12	Forsooth I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
13	The cloak [cloth] which I left at Troas at Carpas, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but most the parchments.
14	Alexander, the treasurer, showed to me much evil; the Lord shall yield to him after his works.
15	Whom also thou eschew; for he against-stood full greatly our words.
16	In my first defence no man helped me, but all forsook me; be it not areckoned to them. [In my first defence no man was to me, but all forsook me; be it not reckoned to them.]
17	But the Lord helped me, and comforted me, that the preaching be filled by me, and that all folks hear, that I am delivered from the mouth of the lion. [Forsooth the Lord stood nigh to me, and comforted me, that the preaching be full-filled by me, and that all folks hear, and I am delivered from the mouth of the lion.]
18	And the Lord delivered me from all evil work, and shall make me safe into his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory into worlds of worlds.  Amen.
19	Greet well Prisca, and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
20	Erastus left at Corinth [Forsooth Erastus dwelt at Corinth], and I left Trophimus sick at Miletum.
21	Hie thou to come before winter.  Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all brethren, greet thee well.
22	Our Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.  The grace of God be with you.  Amen.
