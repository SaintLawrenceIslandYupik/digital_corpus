1	That thing that was from the beginning [Which thing was from the beginning], which we heard, which we saw with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands touched, of the word of life;
2	and the life is showed.  And we saw, and witness, and tell to you the everlasting life, that was with the Father, and appeared to us.
3	Therefore that thing, that we saw, and heard, we tell to you, that also ye have fellowship with us, and our fellowship be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.
4	And we write this thing to you [And this thing we write to you], that ye have joy, and that your joy be full.
5	And this is the telling, that we heard of him, and tell to you, that God is light, and there be no darknesses in him.
6	If we say, that we have fellowship with him, and we wander in darknesses, we lie, and do not truth.
7	But if we walk in light, as also he is in light, we have fellowship together; and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin.
8	If we say, that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and truth is not in us.
9	If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just, that he forgive to us our sins, and cleanse us from all wickedness.
10	And if we say [If we say], that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
