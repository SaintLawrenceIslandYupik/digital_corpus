1	Therefore I beseech first of all things, that beseechings, prayers, askings, doing of thankings, be made for all men,
2	for kings and all that be set in highness, that we lead a quiet and a peaceable life, in all piety and chastity.
3	For this thing is good and accepted before God, our Saviour,
4	that will that all men be made safe, and that they come to the knowing of truth. [that will all men to be made safe, and to come to the knowing of truth.]
5	For one God and one mediator is of God and of men, a man Christ Jesus,
6	that gave himself redemption for all men.  Whose witnessing is confirmed in his times;
7	in which I am set a preacher and an apostle.  For I say truth, and I lie not, that am a teacher of heathen men in faith and in truth [Soothly I say truth in Christ Jesus, and I lie not, a teacher of heathen men in faith and truth].
8	Therefore I will, that men pray in all place, lifting up clean hands without wrath and strife [lifting up clean hands without wrath and disputing, or strife].
9-10	Also women in suitable habit, with shamefastness and soberness arraying themselves [Also and women in adorned, or covenable, habit, with shamefastness and soberness adorning themselves], not in wreathed hairs, either in gold, or pearls, or precious cloth; but that that becometh women, promising piety by good works.
11	A woman learn [she] in silence, with all subjection.
12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, neither to have lordship on the husband [neither for to have lordship on the man], but to be in silence.
13	For Adam was first formed, afterward Eve;
14	and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived, in breaking of the law [in prevarication, or breaking of the law].
15	But she shall be saved by generation of children, if she dwell perfectly in faith, and love, and holiness, with soberness.
