1	And it was done in those days, a commandment went out from the emperor Augustus [a commandment went out from Caesar Augustus], that all the world should be described.
2	This first describing was made of Cyrenius, justice of Syria [justice, or keeper, of Syria].
3	And all men went to make profession, [or acknowledging,] each into his own city. [+And all went, that they should make profession, or acknowledging, each by himself into his city.]
4	And Joseph went up from Galilee, from the city Nazareth [of the city of Nazareth], into Judaea, into a city of David, that is called Bethlehem, for that he was of the house and of the family of David,
5	that he should acknowledge with Mary, his wife, that was wedded to him, and was great with child. [that he should acknowledge with Mary, spoused to him wife, with child.]
6	And it was done, while they were there, the days were fulfilled, that she should bear child.
7	And she bare her firstborn son, and wrapped him in ?clothes, and laid him in a feed-trough [and put him in a cratch], for there was no place to him in no chamber.
8	And shepherds were in the same country, waking and keeping the watches of the night on [upon] their flock.
9	And lo! the angel of the Lord stood beside them, and the clearness of God shined about them [and the clearness of God shone about them]; and they dreaded with great dread.
10	And the angel said to them, Do not ye dread; for lo! I preach to you a great joy [lo! soothly I evangelize to you a great joy], that shall be to all people.
11	For a Saviour is born to day to you, that is Christ the Lord, in the city of David.
12	And this is a token to you; ye shall find a young child wrapped in ?clothes, and laid in a feed-trough [and put in a cratch].
13	And suddenly there was made with the angel a multitude of heavenly knighthood, praising God, and saying,
14	Glory be in the highest things to God, and in earth peace be to men of good will. [Glory in the highest things to God, and in earth peace to men of good will.]
15	And it was done, as the angels passed away from them into heaven, the shepherds spake together, and said, Go we over [till] to Bethlehem, and see we this word that is made, which the Lord hath made, and showed to us.
16	And they hieing came, and found Mary and Joseph, and the young child laid in a feed-trough [put in a cratch].
17	And they seeing, knew of the word that was said to them of this child.
18	And all men that heard wondered, and of these things that were said to them of the shepherds.
19	But Mary kept all these words, bearing together in her heart.
20	And the shepherds turned again, glorifying and praising God in all things that they had heard and seen, as it was said to them.
21	And after that eight days were ended, that the child should be circumcised, his name was called Jesus, which was called of the angel, before that he was conceived in the womb.
22	And after that the days of the purification of Mary were fulfilled, after Moses’ law, they took him into Jerusalem, to offer him to the Lord,
23	as it is written in the law of the Lord, For every male-kind opening the womb, shall be called holy to the Lord;
24	and that they shall give an offering, after that it is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons [or two culver birds].
25	And lo! a man was in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was just and virtuous, and abode the comfort of Israel [and this man was just and dread-full, abiding the comfort of Israel]; and the Holy Ghost was in him.
26	And he had taken an answer of the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, but he saw first the Christ of the Lord.
27	And he came in Spirit into the temple.  And when his father and mother led [in] the child Jesus to do after the custom of the law for him,
28	he took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,
29-30	Lord, now thou lettest go thy servant after thy word in peace; [Lord, now thy leavest thy servant after thy word in peace;] for mine eyes have seen thine health,
31	which thou hast made ready before the face of all peoples;
32	light to the showing of heathen men, and glory of thy people Israel.
33	And his father and his mother were wondering on [upon] these things, that were said of him.
34	And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his mother, Lo! this is set into the falling down and into the rising again [into the falling and into the rising again] of many men in Israel, and into a token, to whom it shall be against-said.
35	And a sword shall pass through thine own soul, that the thoughts be showed of many hearts.
36	And Anna was a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the lineage of Aser.  And she had gone forth in many days, and had lived with her husband seven years from her maidenhood.
37	And this was a widow to fourscore years and four; and she departed not from the temple [which departed not from the temple], but served God night and day in fastings and prayers.
38	And this came upon them in that hour, and acknowledged to the Lord [And this in that hour above coming, acknowledged to the Lord], and spake of him to all that abided the redemption of Israel.
39	And as they had full done all things [And as they had perfectly done all things], after the law of the Lord, they turned again into Galilee, into their city Nazareth.
40	And the child waxed, and was comforted, full of wisdom; and the grace of God was in him.
41	And his father and mother went each year into Jerusalem [And his father and mother went by all years into Jerusalem], in the solemn day of pask.
42	And when Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem, after the custom of the feast day.
43	And when the days were done, they turned again; and the child abode in Jerusalem, and his father and mother knew it not.
44	For they guessing that he had been in the fellowship, came a day’s journey, and sought him among his cousins and his acknowledged. [+Forsooth they guessing him to be in the company, or fellowship, came the way, or journey, of a day, and sought him among his cousins and known.]
45	And when they found him not, they turned again into Jerusalem, and sought him [seeking him].
46	And it befell [And it was done], that after the third day they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the doctors, hearing them and asking them.
47	And all men that heard him, wondered on the prudence and the answers of him.
48	And they saw, and wondered.  And his mother said to him, Son, what hast thou done to us thus?  Lo! thy father and I sorrowing have sought thee.
49	And he said to them, What is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that in those things that be of my Father [wist ye not, that in those things that be my Father’s], it behooveth me to be?
50	And they understood not the word, which he spake to them.
51	And he came down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them.  And his mother kept together all these words, and bare them in her heart [bearing together in her heart].
52	And Jesus profited in wisdom, age, and grace, with God and men.
