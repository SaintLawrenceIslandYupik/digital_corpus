1	And again he entered into Capernaum, after eight days.  And it was heard, that he was in an house,
2	and many came together, so that they might not be in the house, nor at the gate [so that it took them not, neither at the gate].  And he spake to them the word.
3	And there came to him men that brought a man sick in the palsy [And there came to him men bringing a sick man in palsy], which was borne of four.
4	And when they might not bring him to Jesus for the people [And when they might not offer him to him for the company of people], they uncovered the roof where he was, and [they] opened it, and they let down the bed in which the sick man in palsy lay.
5	And when Jesus had seen the faith of them, he said to the sick man in palsy [Soothly when Jesus saw the faith of them, he saith to the sick man in palsy], Son, thy sins be forgiven to thee.
6	But there were some of the scribes sitting, and thinking in their hearts,
7	What speaketh he thus?  He blasphemeth; who may forgive sins, but God alone?
8	And [anon] when Jesus had known this by the Holy Ghost, that they thought so within themselves, he saith to them [Jesus said to them], What think ye these things in your hearts?
9	What is lighter to say to the sick man in palsy, Sins be forgiven to thee, or to say, Rise, take thy bed, and walk?
10	But that ye know that man’s Son hath power in earth to forgive sins, he said to the sick man in palsy [he saith to the sick man in palsy],
11	I say to thee, rise up, [and] take thy bed, and go into thine house.
12	And at once he rose up, and when he had taken the bed [And anon, he rose up, and, the bed taken up], he went before all men, so that all men wondered, and honoured God, and said [saying], For we saw never so.
13	And he went out again to the sea, and all the people [and all the company of people] came to him; and he taught them.
14	And when he passed, he saw Levi of Alphaeus sitting at the tollbooth, and he said to him, Follow me.  And he rose, and followed him.
15	And it was done, when he sat at the meat in his house, many publicans and sinful men sat together at the meat [sat together at meat] with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many that followed him.
16	And scribes and Pharisees seeing, that he ate with publicans and sinful men, said to his disciples, Why eateth and drinketh your master with publicans and sinners [Why your master eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners]?
17	When this was heard, Jesus said to them, Whole men have no need to a physician, but they that be evil-at-ease [This thing heard, Jesus saith to them, Whole men have no need to a leech, but they that have evil]; for I came not to call just men, but sinners.
18	And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they came, and said to him, Why fast the disciples of John, and the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? [And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they came, and say to him, Why the disciples of John and of Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?]
19	And Jesus said to them, Whether the sons of the spousals be able to fast [Whether the sons of the weddings may fast], as long as the spouse is with them?  As long time as they have the spouse with them, they be not able to fast [they may not fast].
20	But days shall come, when the spouse shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.
21	No man seweth a patch of new cloth to an old cloak [to an old cloth], else he taketh away [else it taketh away] the new patch from the old, and a more breaking is made.
22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles, else the wine shall burst the bottles, and the wine shall be shed out [and the wine shall be poured out], and the bottles shall perish.  But new wine shall be put into new bottles [But new wine oweth to be put into new wine vessels].
23	And it was done again, when the Lord walked in the sabbaths by the corns, and his disciples began to pass forth [and his disciples began to go forth], and [to] pluck ears of the corn.
24	And the Pharisees said to him, Lo! what thy disciples do in the sabbaths, that is not leaveful [Lo! what do thy disciples in sabbaths, the thing that is not leaveful(?)].
25	And he said to them, Read ye never what David did, when he had need, and he hungered, and they that were with him?
26	How he went into the house of God, under Abiathar, prince of priests, and ate loaves of proposition [and ate loaves of proposition, either of setting forth], which it was not leaveful to eat, but to priests alone, and he gave to them that were with him.
27	And he said to them, The sabbath is made for man, and not man for the sabbath;
28	and so man’s Son is Lord also of the sabbath.
