1	Blame thou not an elder man, but beseech [him] as a father, young men as brethren;
2	old women as mothers, young women as sisters, in all chastity.
3	Honour thou widows [Honour the widows], that be very widows.
4	But if any widow hath children of sons [Forsooth if any widow hath sons, or cousins], learn she first to govern her house, and requite to father and mother; for this thing is accepted before God.
5	And she that is a widow verily, and desolate, hope [she] into God, and be busy in beseechings and prayers night and day.
6	For she that is living in delights, is dead [in soul].
7	And command thou this thing [And this thing command thou], that they be without reproof.
8	For if any man hath not care of his own, and most(ly) of his household members, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an unfaithful man [and is worse than an unfaithful, or heathen, man].
9	A widow be chosen [into the temple] not less than sixty years, that was wife of one husband,
10	and hath witnessing in good works, if she nourished children [having witnessing in good works, if she nourished sons], if she received poor men to harbour, if she hath washed the feet of holy men, if she ministered to men that suffered tribulation [if she under-ministered to men suffering tribulation], if she followed all good work.
11	But eschew younger widows; for when they have done lechery, they will be wedded in Christ, [Forsooth eschew younger widows; forsooth when they have done lechery in Christ, they will be wedded,]
12	having damnation, for they have made void the first faith.
13	Also [and] they idle learn to go about houses, not only idle, but [they be] full of words and curious [but and full of words and curiosity], speaking things that it behooveth not.
14	Therefore I will, that younger widows be wedded, and bring forth children, and be housewives, to give none occasion to the adversary, because of cursed thing [by cause of cursed thing].
15	For now some be turned aback after Satan.
16	If any faithful man hath widows, minister he to them [under-minister he to them], that the church be not charged, that it suffice to them that be very widows.
17	The priests that be well governors [The priests that be well before, that is, truly keep well priesthood], be they had worthy to double honour; most they that travail in word and teaching.
18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not bridle the mouth of the ox threshing, and, A workman is worthy his hire.
19	Do not thou receive accusing against a priest, but under twain or three [two or three] witnesses.
20	But reprove thou men that sin before all men, that also others have dread. [Men sinning before all men reprove thou, that and others have dread.]
21	I pray thee before God [I pray, or adjure, thee before God], and Jesus Christ, and his chosen angels, that thou keep these things without prejudice, and do nothing in bowing to the other side [doing nothing, bowing into another part].
22	Put thou hands to no man, neither at once commune thou with other men’s sins [Put thou hands to no man soon, neither commune thou with other men’s sins].  Keep thyself chaste.
23	Do not thou yet drink water, but use a little wine, for thy stomach, and for thine oft falling infirmities.
24	Some men’s sins be open, before going to doom; but of some men they come after. [Some men’s sins be open, going before to doom; forsooth of some men and they follow.]
25	And also good deeds be open, and those that have them in other manner be not able to be hid. [Also and good deeds be open, and they that have them otherwise, may not be hid.]
