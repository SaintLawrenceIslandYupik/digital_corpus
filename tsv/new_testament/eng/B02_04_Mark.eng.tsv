1	And again Jesus began to teach at the sea; and much people [and much company of people] was gathered to him, so that he went into a boat, and sat in the sea, and all the people [and all the company of people] was about the sea on the land.
2	And he taught them in parables many things.  And he said to them in his teaching,
3	Hear ye.  Lo! a man sowing goeth out to sow. [Hear ye.  Lo! a sower went out to sow.]
4	And while he soweth, some seed felled about the way, and birds of heaven came, and ate it. [+And the while he soweth, some seed felled beside the way, and birds of heaven, or of the air, came, and ate it.]
5	Other [Forsooth another] felled down on stony places, where it had not much earth; and at once it sprang up, for it had not deepness of earth [and anon it sprang up, for it had no deepness of earth].
6	And when the sun rose up, it withered for heat, and it dried up, for it had no root.
7	And other felled down into thorns [And another felled down among thorns], and [the] thorns sprang up, and strangled it, and it gave no fruit.
8	And other felled down into good land, and gave fruit, springing up, and waxing; and one brought thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one an hundredfold.
9	And he said, He that hath ears of hearing, hear he. [And he said, He that hath ears to hear, hear.]
10	And when he was by himself, the twelve that were with him asked him to expound the parable.
11	And he said to them, To you it is given to know the private of the kingdom of God [To you it is given to know the mystery, or private, of the kingdom of God].  But to them that be withoutforth, all things be made in parables,
12	that they seeing see, and see not, and they hearing hear, and understand not; lest [that] sometime they be converted, and sins be forgiven to them.
13	And he said to them, Know not ye this parable? and how ye shall know all parables?
14	He that soweth, soweth a word.
15	But these it be that be about the way, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, at once cometh Satan [anon cometh Satan], and taketh away the word that is sown in their hearts.
16	And in like manner be these [these it be] that be sown on stony places, which when they have heard the word, at once they take it with joy [anon take it with joy];
17	and they have not root in themselves, but they be lasting [but] a little time; afterward when tribulation riseth, and persecution for the word, at once they be caused to stumble. [and they have not root in themselves, but they be temporal, that is, lasting a little time; afterward when tribulation and persecution riseth for the word, anon they be offended.]
18	And there be others that be sown in thorns; these it be that hear the word,
19	and dis-ease of the world, and deceit of riches, and other charge of covetousness entereth, and strangleth the word, and it is made without fruit. [and mis-eases of the world, and deceit of riches, and other charge of covetousness entering in, strangle the word, and it is made without fruit.]
20	And these it be that be sown on good land, which hear the word, and take, and make fruit, one thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one an hundredfold.
21	And he said to them, Where a lantern cometh, that it be put under a bushel, or under a bed? nay, but that it be put on a candlestick? [+And he said to them, Whether a lantern come, that it be put under a bushel, or under a bed? whether not, that it be put upon a candlestick?]
22	[Forsooth] There is nothing hid, that shall not be made open [that shall not be showed]; neither any thing is privy, that shall not come into open [which shall not come into apert].
23	If any man have ears of hearing, hear he.
24	And he said to them, See ye what ye hear.  In what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you again [it shall be meted to you], and it shall be cast to you.
25	For it shall be given to him that hath, and it shall be taken away from him that hath not, also that that he hath. [Forsooth it shall be given to him that hath, and if man hath not, yea this that he hath shall be taken away from him.]
26	And he said, So the kingdom of God is, as if a man cast seed into the earth,
27	and he sleep, and it rise up night and day [and it sleep, and rise up in night and day], and bring forth seed, and wax fast, while he knoweth not.
28	For the earth [by his own working/by his own will] maketh fruit, first the grass, afterward the ear, and after full fruit in the ear [afterward full fruit in the ear].
29	And when of itself it hath brought forth fruit, at once [anon] he sendeth a sickle, for reaping time is come.
30	And he said, To what thing shall we liken the kingdom of God? or to what parable shall we comparison it?
31	As a corn of mustard seed, which when it is sown in the earth, is less than all seeds that be in the earth;
32	and when it is sprung up, it waxeth into a tree, and is made greater than all herbs [and when it is sown, it waxeth into a tree, and is made more than all worts, or herbs]; and it maketh great branches, so that [the] birds of heaven may dwell [be able to dwell] under the shadow thereof.
33	And in many such parables he spake to them the word, as they might hear;
34	and he spake not to them without parable.  But he expounded to his disciples all things by themselves [+Forsooth he expounded to his disciples all things on sides hand/on sides half, or by themselves].
35-36	And he said to them in that day, when evening was come, Pass we over to the other side. [And he saith to them in that day, when evening was made, Pass we again-ward.] And they let go the people, and took him, so that he was in a boat [And they leaving the company of people, took him, so that he was in the boat]; and other boats were with him.
37	And a great storm of wind was made, and cast waves into the boat, so that the boat was full. [And there was made a great tempest of wind, and sent floods into the ship, so that the ship was full-filled.]
38	And he was in the hinder part of the boat, and slept on a pillow [+And he was in the hinder part of the ship, sleeping on a pillow].  And they raise him, and say to him, Master, pertaineth it not to thee, that we perish?
39	And he rose up, and menaced the wind, and said to the sea, Be still, wax dumb.  And the wind ceased, and great peaceableness was made.
40	And he said to them, What dread ye?  Yet ye have no faith?  [And he said to them, What be ye dread-full?  Not yet have ye faith?]
41	And they dreaded with great dread, and said to each other [and said each to other], Who, guessest thou, is this? for the wind and the sea obey to him.
