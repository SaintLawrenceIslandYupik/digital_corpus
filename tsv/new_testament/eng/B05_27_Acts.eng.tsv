1	But as it was deemed him to ship into Italy, they betook Paul with other keepers to a centurion [they betook Paul with other kept to a centurion], by name Julius, of the company of knights of the emperor.
2	And we went up into the ship of Adramyttium, and began to sail, and were borne about the places of Asia, while Aristarchus of Macedonia, Thessalonica, dwelled still with us.
3	And in the day following, we came to Sidon; and Julius treated courteously Paul, and suffered [him] to go to friends, and to do his needs [and to do the care, or need, of him].
4	And when we removed from thence [And when we had taken up from thence], we under-sailed to Cyprus, for that winds were contrary.
5	And we sailed in the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, and came to Lystra, that is Lycia.
6	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing into Italy, and putted [put] us over into it.
7	And when in many days we sailed slowly, and scarcely came against Cnidus, for the wind hindered us [And when many days we sailed slowly, and scarcely came against Cnidus, the wind forbidding us], we sailed to Crete, beside Salmone.
8	And scarcely we sailed beside, and came into a place [And scarcely we beside sailing, came into some place], that is called of good haven, to whom the city Lasea was nigh.
9	And when much time was passed, and when sailing then was not secure [and when now sailing was not secure], for that fasting was passed, Paul comforted them,
10	and said to them, Men, I see that sailing beginneth to be with wrong and much harm, not only of the charge and of the ship [not only of charge and ship], but also of our lives.
11	But the centurion believed more to the governor, and to the lord of the ship, than to these things that were said of Paul.
12	And when the haven was not able to dwell in winter, full many ordained counsel to sail from thence, if on any manner they might come to Phenice, to dwell in winter at the haven of Crete [+And when the haven was not able to dwell in winter, full many ordained counsel to sail thence, if in any manner they might come to Phenice, to wintern in the haven of Crete], which beholdeth to Africa, or south west, and to Corum, or north west.
13	And when the south blew, they guessed them to hold purpose; and when they had removed from Assos, they sailed to Crete. [Soothly the south blowing, they guessing them to hold purpose, when they had taken up from Assos, sailed to Crete.]
14	And not after much [time], the wind Tifonyk, that is called north east, was against it. [+Soothly not after much time, the wind Tifonyk, that is called north east, or wind of tempest, sent him against it.]
15	And when the ship was snatched, and might not endeavour against the wind, when the ship was given to the blowings of the wind, we were borne [And when the ship was snatched, and might not endeavour into the wind, the ship given to blowings, we were borne.]
16	with course into an isle, that is called Clauda; and scarcely we might get a little boat. [Soothly we running into some isle that is called Clauda, scarcely might get a little boat.]
17	And when this was taken up, they used helps, girding together the ship; and dreaded, lest they should fall into sandy places.  And when the vessel was under-set, so they were borne. [The which taken up, with helps, they used girding together of the ship, dreading lest they should fall into the sandy places; the vessel under-set, so they were borne.]
18	And for we were thrown with strong tempest [Soothly us thrown with great tempest], in the day following they made casting out.
19	And the third day with their hands they cast away the instruments of the ship.
20	And when the sun neither the stars were seen by many days, and tempest not a little approached [Soothly neither sun neither stars appearing by many days, and tempest not little showing nigh], now all the hope of our health was done away.
21	And when much fasting had been, then Paul stood in the middle of them, and said, A! men, it behooved, when ye heard me, not to have taken away the ship from Crete, and get this wrong and casting out. [And when much fasting had been, then Paul standing in the middle of them said, A! men, it behooved me heard, to not take away from Crete, and to win this wrong and casting out.]
22	And now I counsel you to be of good comfort, for loss of no person of you shall be, except of the ship. [+And now I counsel you to be of good comfort, or heart; soothly there shall be loss of no soul of you, except of the ship.]
23	For an angel of God, whose I am, and to whom I serve, stood nigh to me in this night [stood nigh to me this night],
24	and said, Paul, dread thou not; it behooveth thee to stand before the emperor [saying, Paul, dread thou not; it behooveth thee to stand nigh to Caesar].  And lo! God hath given to thee all that be in the ship with thee.
25	For which thing, ye men, be of good comfort [be of good comfort, or heart]; for I believe to my God, that so it shall be, as it is said to me.
26	And it behooveth us to come into some isle.
27	But afterward that in the fourteen day the night came on us sailing in the stony sea, about midnight the shipmen supposed some country to appear to them.
28	And they cast down a plummet, and found twenty fathoms of deepness.  And after a little they were departed from thence, and found fifteen fathoms. [The which sending down a plummet, found twenty fathoms of deepness.  And after a little they departed thence, found fifteen fathoms.]
29	And they dreaded, lest we should have fallen into sharp places; and from the last part of the ship they sent four anchors, and desired that the day had be come. [Soothly they dreading lest we should fall into sharp places, from the last part of the ship sending four anchors, desired day to be made.]
30	And when the shipmen sought to flee from the ship, when they had sent a little boat into the sea, under colour as they should begin to stretch forth the anchors from the former part of the ship,
31	Paul said to the centurion and to the knights, But these dwell in the ship, ye be not able to be made safe [ye may not be made safe].
32	Then [the] knights cutted [cut] away the cords of the little boat, and suffered it to fall away.
33	And when the day was come, Paul prayed all men to take meat, and said [saying], The fourteenth day this day ye abide, and dwell fasting, and take nothing [nothing taken].
34	Wherefore I pray you to take meat, for your health; for of none of you the hair of the head shall perish.
35	And when he had said these things, Paul took bread, and did thankings to God in the sight of all men [And when he had said these things, he taking bread did thankings to God in the sight of all men]; and when he had broken, he began to eat.
36	And all were made of better comfort [Forsooth all made more patient, or hearty], and they took meat.
37	And we were all men in the ship, two hundred seventy and six. [Soothly we were all the souls in the ship, two hundred seventy and six.]
38	And they were filled with meat, and discharged the ship, and cast wheat into the sea. [And they full-filled with meat, discharged the ship, casting out wheat into the sea.]
39	And when the day was come, they knew no land; and they beheld an haven that had a water bank, into which they thought, if they might, to bring up the ship. [Soothly when day was made, they knew not land; forsooth they beheld some haven having a water bank, into which they thought, if they might, to cast the ship.]
40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they betook them to the sea, and slacked together the jointures of rudders [And when they had taken up the anchors, they betook them into the sea, and slaked together the jointures of rudders].  And with a little sail lifted up, by blowing of the wind [after blowing of the wind] they went to the bank.
41	And when we felled into a place of gravel gone all about with the sea, they hurtled the ship.  And when the former part was fixed, it dwelled unmoveable [And the former part fixed, dwelled unmoveable], and the last part was broken of the strength of the sea.
42	And counsel of the knightsâ€™ was, to slay men that were in ward, lest any should escape, when he had swimmed out. [Soothly the counsel of the knights? was, to slay men in the keeping, lest any should escape, when he had swum out.]
43	But the centurion would keep Paul, and forbade it to be done.  And he commanded them that might swim, to go into the sea, and escape, and go out to the land. [Forsooth the centurion willing to keep Paul, forbade to be done.  And he commanded them that might swim, to send them first into the sea, and escape, and go out to the land.]
44	And they bare some others on boards, some on those things that were of the ship.  And so it was done, that all men escaped to the land. [+And some others they bare in boards, some on those things that were of the ship.  And so it was made, that all the souls escaped to the land.]
