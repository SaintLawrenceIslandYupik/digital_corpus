1	But we helping [you in work and word] admonish [you], that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.
2	For he saith, In time well pleasing I have heard thee [In time accepted, or well pleasing, I have heard thee], and in the day of health I have helped thee.  Lo! now a time acceptable, lo! now a day of health.
3	Give we to no man any offence, that our service be not reproved; [To no man giving any offence, or hurting, that our ministry, or service, be not reproved;]
4	but in all things give we us selves [but in all things give we ourselves] as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in anguishes,
5	in beatings [in scourgings], in prisons, in dissensions within, in travails, in wakings, in fastings,
6	in chastity, in knowing [in science, or knowing], in long abiding, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity not feigned,
7	in the word of truth, in the virtue of God; by armours of rightwiseness on the right half and on the left half;
8	by glory and unnobleness [by glory and unnobility]; by evil fame and good fame; as deceivers, and true men;
9	as they that be unknown and known; as men dying, and lo! we live; as chastised, and not made dead;
10	as sorrowful, and evermore joying; as having need, but making many men rich [as sorrowful, but evermore joying; as needy men, soothly making many rich]; as nothing having, and wielding all things.
11	A! ye Corinthians [O! ye Corinthians], our mouth is open to you, our heart is alarged;
12	ye be not anguished in us, but ye be anguished in your inwardnesses. [+ye be not made strait in us, but ye be made strait, or be ye anguished, in your entrails.]
13	And I say as to sons, ye that have the same reward, be ye alarged. [Forsooth, we having the same reward, I say as to sons, and be ye alarged.]
14	Do not ye bear the yoke with unfaithful men.  For what parting of rightwiseness with wickedness [Soothly what parting, or communing, of rightwiseness with wickedness]? or what fellowship of light to darknesses?
15	and what according of Christ to Belial? or what part of a faithful [man] with the unfaithful [or heathen]?
16	and what consent to the temple of God with maumets?  And ye be the temple of the living God, as the Lord saith, For I shall dwell in them, and I shall walk among them; and I shall be [the] God of them, and they shall be a people to me. [but what consent to the temple of God with idols?  Forsooth ye be the temple of quick God, as the Lord saith, For I shall dwell in them, and I shall walk in; and I shall be the God of them, and they shall be to me a people.]
17	For which thing go ye out of the middle of them, and be ye separated [and be ye parted], saith the Lord, and touch not unclean thing; and I shall receive you,
18	and I shall be to you into a Father, and ye shall be to me into sons and daughters, saith the Lord almighty.
