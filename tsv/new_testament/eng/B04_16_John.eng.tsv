1	These things I have spoken to you, that ye be not caused to stumble [that ye be not offended].
2	They shall make you without the synagogues, but the hour cometh, that each man that slayeth you, deem that he doeth service to God.
3	And they shall do to you these things, for they have not known the Father, neither me.
4	But these things I spake to you, that when the hour of them shall come, ye have mind, that I said to you.  I said not to you these things from the beginning, for I was with you.
5	And now I go to him that sent me, and no man of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
6	but for I have spoken to you these things, heaviness hath full-filled your heart [sorrow, or heaviness, hath full-filled your heart].
7	But I say to you truth, it speedeth to you, that I go; for if I go not forth [soothly if I shall not go away], the comforter shall not come to you; but if I go forth [forsooth if I shall go away], I shall send him to you.
8	And when he cometh [And when he shall come], he shall reprove the world of sin, and of rightwiseness, and of doom.
9	Of sin, for they have not believed in me;
10	and of rightwiseness, for I go to the Father, and now ye shall not see me;
11	but of doom, for the prince of this world is now deemed.
12	Yet I have many things to say to you, but ye be not able to bear them now.
13	But when the Spirit of truth cometh [shall come], he shall teach you all truth; for he shall not speak of himself, but whatever things he shall hear, he shall speak; and he shall tell to you those things [and he shall tell to you the things] that be to come.
14	He shall clarify me, for of mine he shall take, and shall tell to you.
15	All things, whatever [things] the Father hath, be mine; therefore I said to you, that of mine he shall take, and shall tell to you.
16	A little, and then ye shall not see me; and again a little, and ye shall see me, for I go to the Father.
17	Therefore some of his disciples said together, What is this thing that he saith to us, A little, and ye shall not see me; and again a little, and ye shall see me, for I go to the Father?
18	Therefore they said, What is this that he saith to us, A little? we know not what he speaketh.
19	And Jesus knew, that they would ask him, and he said to them, Of this thing ye seek among you, for I said, A little, and ye shall not see me; and again a little, and ye shall see me.
20	Truly, truly, I say to you, that ye shall mourn and weep, but the world shall have joy; and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall turn into joy.
21	A woman when she beareth child, hath heaviness [hath sorrow, or heaviness], for her time is come; but when she hath born a son, now she thinketh not on the pain, for joy, for a man is born into the world.
22	And therefore ye have now sorrow, but again I shall see you, and your heart shall have joy, and no man shall take from you your joy.
23	And in that day ye shall not ask me any thing; truly, truly, I say to you, if ye ask the Father any thing in my name, he shall give [it] to you.
24	Till now ye asked nothing in my name; ask ye, and ye shall take, that your joy be full.
25	I have spoken to you these things in proverbs; the hour cometh, when now I shall not speak to you in proverbs, but openly of my Father I shall tell to you [I shall tell you].
26	In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I shall pray the Father for you;
27	for the Father himself loveth you, for ye have loved me, and have believed, that I went out from God.
28	I went out from the Father, and I came into the world; again I leave the world, and go to the Father.
29	His disciples said to him, Lo! now thou speakest openly, and thou sayest no proverb.
30	Now we know, that thou knowest all things; and it is not need to thee [and it is no need to thee], that any man ask thee.  In this thing we believe, that thou wentest out from God.
31	Jesus answered to them, Now ye believe.
32	Lo! the hour cometh, and now it cometh, that ye be scattered, each into his own things, and that ye leave me alone; and I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
33	These things I have spoken to you, that ye have peace in me; in the world ye shall have dis-ease [in the world ye shall have pressing, or overlaying], but trust ye, I have overcome the world.
