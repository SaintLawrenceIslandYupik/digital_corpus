1	Therefore I, an even-elder man, and a witness of Christ’s passions, which also am a communer of that glory, that shall be showed in time to come; beseech the elder men, that be among you, [+Therefore I, even-elder and a witness of Christ’s passions, beseech the elder men that be in you, which also am a communer of that glory that shall be showed in time to come,]
2	feed ye the flock of God, that is among you, and purvey ye, not as constrained, but willfully, by God [purveying not constrainingly, but willfully, after God]; not for love of foul winning, but willfully,
3	neither as having lordship in the clergy, but that ye be made ensample to the flock, of will. [+neither as having lordship in the clergy, but made form, or example, of the flock, and of intent, either will.]
4	And when the prince of shepherds shall appear, ye shall receive the crown of glory, that may never fade [that shall never fade].
5	Also, ye young men, be ye subject to elder men, and all show ye together meekness [+Also ye younger men, be subject to elder men, forsooth all show ye together meekness]; for the Lord withstandeth proud men, but he giveth grace to meek men.
6	Therefore be ye meeked under the mighty hand of God, that he raise you in the time of visitation [that he raise you in the day of visitation],
7	and cast ye all your busyness into him, for to him is care of you. [ye casting into him all your busyness, for to him is care of you.]
8	Be ye sober, and wake ye, for your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion goeth about, seeking whom he shall devour.
9	Whom against stand ye, strong in the faith, witting that the same passion is made to that brotherhood of you, that is in the world [witting the same passion to be done to that your brotherhood, that is in the world].
10	And God of all grace, that called you into his everlasting glory, you suffering a little [in Christ Jesus], he shall perform, and shall confirm, and shall make firm [he shall perform, shall confirm, and shall make firm].
11	To him be glory and lordship, into worlds of worlds.  Amen.
12	By Silvanus, [a] faithful brother to you as I deem, I wrote shortly; beseeching, and witnessing that this is the very grace of God, in which ye stand.
13	The church that is gathered in Babylon, and Marcus, my son, greeteth you well. [The church that is gathered at Babylon greeteth you well, and Marcus, my son.]
14	Greet ye well together in holy kiss.  Grace be to you all that be in Christ.  Amen.
