1	Do now, ye rich men, weep ye, yelling in your wretchednesses that shall come to you.
2	Your riches be rotten, and your clothes be eaten of moths.
3	Your gold and silver hath rusted, and the rust of them shall be to you into witnessing, and shall eat your fleshes, as fire.  Ye have treasured to you wrath in the last days.
4	Lo! the hire of your workmen, that reaped your fields, which is defrauded of you [which is frauded of you], crieth; and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.
5	Ye have eaten on the earth, and in your lecheries ye have nourished your hearts.  In the day of slaying
6	ye brought, and slew the just man, and he against-stood not you [and he withstood you not].
7	Therefore, brethren, be ye patient, till to the coming of the Lord.  Lo! an earth-tiller abideth [the] precious fruit of the earth, patiently suffering, till he receive timeful and lateful fruit.
8	And be ye patient, and confirm ye your hearts, for the coming of the Lord shall approach. [And be ye patient, and confirm your hearts, for the coming of the Lord shall nigh.]
9	Brethren, do not ye be sorrowful each to other [Brethren, do not ye be scornful each to other], that ye be not deemed.  Lo! the judge standeth nigh before the gate.
10	Brethren, take ye ensample of evil going out, and of long abiding, and travail [Brethren, take ye example of evil going out, and of long abiding of travail], and of patience, the prophets, that spake to you in the name of the Lord.
11	Lo! we bless them that suffered.  Ye have heard the patience of Job, and ye saw the end of the Lord, for the Lord is merciful, and doing mercy.
12	Before all things, my brethren, do not ye swear, neither by heaven, neither by earth, neither by whatever other oath.  But be your word Yea, yea, Nay, nay, that ye fall not under doom.
13	And if any of you is sorrowful [Soothly if any of you is sorrowful, or heavy], pray he with patient soul, and say he a psalm.
14	If any of you is sick, lead he in priests of the church, and pray they for him, and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord [anointing with oil in the name of the Lord];
15	and the prayer of faith shall save the sick man, and the Lord shall make him light [+and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall discharge him, or make him light]; and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven to him.
16	Therefore acknowledge ye each to other your sins, and pray ye each for other, that ye be saved [Therefore acknowledge ye one to another your sins, and pray ye for each other, that ye be saved].  For the continual prayer of a just man is much worth.
17	Elias was a deadly man like us [Elias was a man like to us passible, or able to suffer], and in prayer he prayed, that it should not rain on the earth, and it rained not three years and six months.
18	And again he prayed, and heaven gave rain, and the earth gave his fruit.
19-20	And, brethren, if any of you erreth from truth, and any converteth him, [Brethren, forsooth if any of you shall err from the truth, and any shall convert him,] he oweth to know, that he that maketh a sinner to be turned from the error of his way, shall save the soul of him from death, and covereth the multitude of sins.  [Amen.]
