Preface
by Steven A. Jacobson
The language of these stories, Siberian Yupik, is the ancestral language of slightly more than 2,000 people almost equally divided between St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, and the eastern tip of Chukotka in Russia. The language is known by a variety of names, including specifically "Yupigestun" or "Akuzipik" in the language itself, "the Chaplinski dialect (of Eskimo)" in Russia, "Central Siberian Yupik," "Beringian Yupik," "Yuit," and "Asian Eskimo." Whatever the label, it has the distinction of being the only indigenous language found in both America and Eurasia. It is also the only Eskimo-Aleut language that has a large number of loan words (about 300-1,000) from another indigenous language, Chukchi. This number of loan words indicates that Siberian Yupik culture has been deeply influenced by Chukchi culture (see Jacobson 2001:130-131).
The stories in the present book were collected some decades ago by Georgiy A. Menovshchikov, a Russian pedagogue and linguist who devoted his working life to the Eskimo languages of Chukotka where he started as a teacher in an Eskimo school in the 1930s. He continued working with the Eskimo languages as a linguist in Leningrad until his death in 1991. He published scholarly grammars and descriptions and pedagogies (1960, 1962,1967,1975), a dictionary (1983), and story collections (1939,1947, 1986,1987,1988,1989), with the later volumes containing newly published stories in addition to others that had appeared in previous volumes. These books, being Soviet publications, had the Yupik written in a specially adapted form of the Cyrillic (Russian) alphabet.1 The 1988 volume from which the present book is derived was more scholarly in format than the others in that accent and vowel length were marked in the Yupik, and the stories were accompanied by Russian translations. In the 1970s Michael Krauss of the University of Alaska made Menovshchikov’s 1939 and 1947 volumes available to St. Lawrence Island Yupiks and others in Alaska by obtaining copies of the Soviet books. He had those and many other Soviet Yupik books photocopied, bound, and deposited in the schools in Gambell, Savoonga, and Nome, in the Alaska State Library in Juneau, in the University of Alaska Rasmuson Library, and in the Alaska Native Language Center archives in Fairbanks. Chris Koonooka (Petuwaq) has here transliterated thirty-five of the stories from the 1988 volume into the standard Latin-letter orthography used for writing Yupik on St. Lawrence Island, and has translated them anew into English. This work will make these stories accessible to a wider readership of Yupiks and others who may not have facility in reading Cyrillic.
In those cases where it was apparent that the original Cyrillic transcription had errors, Koonooka made minor changes in the Yupik. However, when the Russian version used Chukotkan Yupik words and suffixes or grammatical constructions which are not so common on St. Lawrence Island, these Chukotkan Yupik forms were retained. One can contrast this to the practice followed in earlier Alaska Native Language Center transliterations from Russian Yupik books. In Ungazighmiit Ungipaghaatangit, which Adelinda Badten transliterated in 1971 from Rubtsova’s Chukotkan texts, distinctly Chukotkan Yupik words and forms were replaced with those more familiar to St. Lawrence Island Yupik speakers, though the replaced words and forms were noted as such. Back then the two communities were, of course, almost completely isolated from each other. Now Yupiks travel back and forth and—as they should—are becoming more familiar with each other’s form of the language.
In some stories Koonooka changed phraseology to make sentences "read better" according to his feel for the Native language. This is in accord with the Yupik and in fact the general practice of transmission of oral tradition. It is also contrary to the widespread popular view that storytellers recite stories only after memorizing them word for word. The existence of two or more varying but clearly cognate versions of a number of stories in the written and audiotape corpus for Siberian Yupik from both Chukotka and St. Lawrence Island gives ample evidence of the altering process in oral transmission.
Koonooka’s English translations are from the original Yupik, but in cases where he encountered Yupik words with which he was unfamiliar he consulted the Russian translation.
Certainly the most difficult aspect of redoing these stories in the St. Lawrence Island orthography was distinguishing "rhythmically" lengthened but basically short vowels from inherently long vowels in the same position within words. In the form of the language used by the oldest generation of Yupiks, inherently long vowels in the position in question are "overlengthened"; they are of longer duration than rhythmically lengthened short vowels and are pronounced with a falling tone. On the other hand, in the form of the language used by speakers other than the oldest generation, this distinction in sound has virtually disappeared. Krauss noted this as long ago as 1975 in younger Yupik speakers from Savoonga (Krauss 1975:56), and a few years later the present writer noticed that the distinction was also disappearing among young adults in Gambell. Competent speakers of Chris’s generation, and many older speakers as well, are aware of the distinction, especially if pointed out to them in a minimal pair. Otherwise, however, they are sometimes unsure what kind of length a vowel heard as long has and thus whether to write such a vowel with a single or a double vowel letter. Menovshchikov’s scholarly texts do note a distinction by the use of accent marks and macrons, but the distinction is certainly not made accurately or consistently (and similarly in the Soviet Yupik dictionary [Rubtsova 1971]). In those instances where there was some question we had to seek grammatical clues of the sort discussed in the grammar book (Jacobson 2001:7-8). If a case in question was not amenable to such grammatical determination, that is, especially, if it was in a three-syllable base, we consulted the St. Lawrence Island dictionary (Badten, Kaneshiro, and Oovi 1987). The compilers of that dictionary were of the generation, perhaps the last such, that clearly heard the difference between rhythmically lengthened vowels and overlengthened vowels. Some words where the point in question arose were not in the dictionary. In these and other cases, our "educated guesses" and deductions might not have always been correct.
There is always a problem in presenting a translation along with a Native language text. This is quite apart from the question of whether a translation should be offered at all lest its very presence actually prove a detriment to those striving to understand the original. A literal translation may well be the most useful to a reader using that translation as an aid in understanding the Yupik, but its very literalness often results in awkward-sounding English, which hardly reflects the literary merits of the original. Being true to the original in one sense makes the translation untrue in another sense. The usual practice is to adjust the translation so that it reads smoothly in English, trying not to depart any more than necessary from the original. This is what has been done in this book. The translations are Chris Koonooka’s, edited—but no more than necessary for clarity and so that they follow the canons of good English usage—by Tom Alton, the Alaska Native Language Center’s editor. Indeed the sentences of the English and the Yupik correspond virtually one to one. The English translation of each Yupik story follows immediately after the Yupik, and the correspondence between English and Yupik paragraphs is established by paragraph numbers. In summary, the English translations here are intended primarily as an aid in understanding the Yupik. They have not been rewritten in English as is sometimes done in collections of translations of Native stories, especially those without the original Native language.
Yupik words used in the English text are those for which no completely adequate English equivalent exists, such as words for tools, household implements, parts of the house, foods, and supernatural beings. Such words are footnoted and explained at their first occurrence in the book.
Chris Koonooka has made the audio recordings on the included CD of six of the stories in this collection, one from each storyteller. A careful listener will note that in a few places he made minor changes as he read, substituting equivalent forms for those in the written text. This is a natural thing to do. The substitutions affect only suffixes, and are not major changes of word choice or order.
We at the Alaska Native Language Center would like to congratulate Koonooka for his fine work, and express our appreciation of the devoted efforts of the late G. A. Menovshchikov and especially the Yupik storytellers, Alghalek, Asuya, Ayveghhaq, Nanughwaaq, Tagikaq, and Wiri. We also thank Professor David Koester of the Anthropology Department at the University of Alaska Fairbanks for helping Chris obtain his Undergraduate Research Opportunity grant from the Provost’s Office.
We note here the statement of Michael Krauss in his preface to Ungazighmiit Ungipaghaatangit (Badten and Krauss 1971):
We hope you will enjoy reading these stories, and will yourselves want to start writing St. Lawrence Island stories and history down, so that they will be preserved for your future generations as these Ungazighmiit stories are.
Now, two decades later, St. Lawrence Island stories and history are indeed being written down (see the Bibliography). May the present book contribute to the continuation of this activity and reinforce awareness of the linguistic and cultural connections between St. Lawrence Island people and their fellow Yupiks in Chukotka.
