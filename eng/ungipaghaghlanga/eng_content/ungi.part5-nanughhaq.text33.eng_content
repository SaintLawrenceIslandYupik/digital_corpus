A man said to his wife, “OK, give me my drum.
I’m going to sing.”
So she gave him the drum.
He started singing,

“Pamiina-yii-yaa-aa-ngaa-ngaa
Pamiina -yii-yaa-aa-ngaa-ngaa
Down there down there by Sivuqaq
A-aa yugta wants to cry
Cries to want a brother
Down there down there by Sivuqaq
A-ngaa-ngaa, splashing on the water
A-ngaa-ngaa, splashing on the water
Down there by Sivuqaq!”
Then he stopped singing.
The end.
