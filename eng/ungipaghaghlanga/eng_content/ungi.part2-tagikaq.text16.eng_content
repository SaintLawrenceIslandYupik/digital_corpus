There lived—or did they not really live?—a husband and a wife with no children.
One time when the man was going eastward, he saw a woman giving birth.
It was a boy, and the woman stepped on a grass-amulet.
That boy grew up when she brought him home.
Then he climbed up to God.
God’s wife said to him, “Who is this?”
The boy answered, “The grass’s son.”
God said to the child, “Go over to the aurora.”
When he went over, he became an aurora.

The end.
