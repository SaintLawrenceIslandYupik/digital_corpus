Shoving
The tone and expression of voice that is usually accented at a certain syllable in Yupik words when not in a good mood.
In English, it may be best described in two words like, “Do IT!”:
When the little boy was asked to get water by his mother, he replied, "OKAY! I WILL!"
His father scolded him, “Don’t talk in a shoving voice, you’ll get in the habit of it.”
