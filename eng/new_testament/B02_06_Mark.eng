And he commanded to them, that they should make all men sit to meat by companies, on [the] green hay [+upon green hay/on the green hay].

for all saw him, and they were afraid [for all saw him, and were troubled].  And at once [And anon] he spake with them, and said to them, Trust ye, I am; do not ye dread.
