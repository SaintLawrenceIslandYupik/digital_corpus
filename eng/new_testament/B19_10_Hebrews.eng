He saying before, That thou wouldest not sacrifices, and offerings, and burnt sacrifices for sin [He above saying, or before, For thou wouldest not hosts, and offerings, and burnt sacrifices, for sin], nor those things be pleasant to thee, which be offered by the law,
then I said, Lo! I come, that I do thy will, God.  He doeth away the first, that he make steadfast the second.

And the Holy Ghost witnesseth to us; for after that he said [forsooth afterward he said],
This is the testament, which I shall witness to them after those days, the Lord saith [saith the Lord], in giving my laws in the hearts of them, and in the souls of them I shall above write them;

And behold we together in the stirring of charity and of good works;
