And evermore [And ever], night and day, in burials and in hills, he was crying and beating himself with stones.
And he saw Jesus afar, and ran, and worshipped him.

And they came to Jesus, and saw him that had been travailed of the fiend [And they came to Jesus, and they see him that was travailed of the fiend], sitting clothed, and of whole mind; and they dreaded.

when she had heard of Jesus, she came among the people behind, and touched his cloak. [when she had heard of Jesus, she came in the company behind, and touched his cloth.]
For she said, That if I [shall] touch yea his cloak [Soothly she said, For if I shall touch yea his cloth], I shall be safe.
And at once [And anon] the well of her blood was dried up, and she feeled in her body that she was healed of the sickness [and she feeled in the body that she was healed of the sickness].
And at once Jesus knew in himself the virtue that was gone out of him, and he turned to the people, and said [And anon Jesus knowing in himself the virtue that had gone out of him, he, turned to the company, saith], Who touched my clothes?
And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the people thrusting thee [Thou seest the company pressing thee], and sayest [thou], Who touched me?

And they scorned him.  But when all were put out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and they entered [and they enter in], where the damsel lay.
And he held the hand of the damsel, and said to her, Talitha, cumi, that is to say [that is interpreted], Damsel, I say to thee, arise.
And at once [And anon] the damsel rose, and walked; and she was of twelve years.  And they were abashed with a great astonishing.
