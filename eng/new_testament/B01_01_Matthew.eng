And so all the generations from Abraham to David be fourteen generations, and from David [till] to the transmigration of Babylon be fourteen generations, and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ [and from the transmigration of Babylon unto Christ] be fourteen generations.
But the generation of Christ was thus.  When Mary, the mother of Jesus, was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found having of the Holy Ghost in the womb. [Forsooth the generation of Christ was this.  When Mary, his mother, was spoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found having in the womb of the Holy Ghost.]
And Joseph, her husband, for he was rightful, and would not publish her, he would privily have left her. [+Joseph, forsooth, her husband, when he was a just man, or rightful, and would not publish her, would privily forsake her.]
But while he thought these things, lo! the angel of the Lord appeared to him in sleep, and said [lo! the angel of the Lord appeared in sleep, or sweven, to him, saying], Joseph, the son of David, do not thou dread to take Mary, thy wife; for that thing that is born in her is of the Holy Ghost.
And she shall bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall make his people safe from their sins.
For all this thing was done, that it should be fulfilled, that was said of the Lord by a prophet, saying,
Lo! a virgin shall have in [the] womb, and she shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, that is to say [that is interpreted], God with us.
And Joseph rose [up] from sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took Mary, his wife; [Soothly Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord bade him, and took his wife;]
and he knew her not, till she had born her first begotten son, and he called his name Jesus.
