And I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful; seven angels having the seven last vengeances [seven angels having seven the last plagues], for the wrath of God is ended in them.
And I saw as a glassen sea mingled with fire, and them that overcame the beast, and his image, and the number of his name, standing above the glassen sea, having the harps of God;
and singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the lamb, and said [saying], Great and wonderful be thy works, Lord God almighty; thy ways be just and true, Lord, king of worlds.
Lord, who shall not dread thee, and magnify thy name? for thou alone art merciful [for thou alone art pious, or merciful]; for all folks shall come, and worship in thy sight, for thy dooms be open [for thy dooms be opened].
And after these things I saw, and lo! the temple of the tabernacle of witnessing was opened in heaven [and lo! the temple of the tabernacle of witnessing in heaven was opened];
and seven angels having [the] seven plagues, went out of the temple, and were clothed with a stole clean and white [clothed with a stone clean and white], and were before-girded with golden girdles about the breasts.
And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven golden vials, full of the wrath of God, that liveth into worlds of worlds.
And the temple was filled with smoke of the majesty of God, and of the virtue of him; and no man might enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended.
