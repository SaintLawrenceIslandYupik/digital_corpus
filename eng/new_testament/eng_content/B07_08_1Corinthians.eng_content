1	But of these things that be sacrificed to idols, we know, for all we have knowing.  But knowing bloweth, charity edifieth [Soothly science, or knowing, in-bloweth with pride, charity edifieth].
2	But if any man guesseth [Forsooth if any man guess, or deem], that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known how it behooveth him to know.
3	And if any man loveth God, this is known of him.
4	But of meats that be offered to idols, we know, that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.
5	For though there be some that be said gods [For why though there be that be said gods], either in heaven, either in earth, as there be many gods, and many lords;
6	nevertheless to us is one God, the Father, of whom be all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom be all things, and we by him.
7	But not in all men is knowing.  For some men with conscience of idol till now eat as thing offered to idols; and their conscience is defouled, for it is frail [when it is sick].
8	[Forsooth] Meat commendeth us not to God; for neither we shall fail, if we eat not, neither if we eat, we shall have plenty [we shall abound, or have plenty].
9	But see ye, lest peradventure this your leave be made hurting to frail men. [See ye forsooth, lest peradventure this your license, or leave, be made hurting, or offence, to sick men, or frail.]
10	For if any man shall see him, that hath knowing, eating in a place where idols be worshipped, whether his conscience, since it is frail [since it is sick], shall not be edified to eat things offered to idols?
11	And the frail brother [And the sick brother], for whom Christ died, shall perish in thy knowing.
12	For thus ye sinning against brethren, and smiting their frail conscience [and smiting their sick conscience], sin against Christ.
13	Wherefore if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I shall never eat flesh, lest I cause my brother to stumble. [Wherefore if meat causeth my brother to offend, I shall not eat flesh into without end, lest I cause my brother to offend.]
