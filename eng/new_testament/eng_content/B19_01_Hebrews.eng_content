1	God, that spake sometime by prophets in many manners to our fathers, [+Manifold and in many manners sometime God speaking to fathers by prophets,]
2	at the last in these days he hath spoken to us by the Son; whom he hath ordained heir of all things, and by whom he made the worlds.
3	Which when also he is the brightness of glory, and [the] figure of his substance, and beareth all things [and bearing all things] by word of his virtue, he maketh purgation of sins, and sitteth on the right half of the majesty in heavens [sitteth on the right half of majesty in high things];
4	and so much is made better than angels, by how much he hath inherited a more diverse name [a more different, or excellent, name] before them.
5	For to which of the angels said God any time, Thou art my Son, I have engendered thee to day [I have to day gendered thee]?  And again, I shall be to him into a Father, and he shall be to me into a Son?
6	And when again he bringeth in the first begotten Son into the world [And when again he bringeth in the first begotten into the roundness of the earth], he saith, And all the angels of God worship him.
7	But he saith to angels [And soothly to angels he saith], He that maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers flame of fire.
8	But to the Son he saith, God, thy throne is into the world of world [into the world of worlds]; a rod of equity is the rod of thy realm;
9	thou hast loved rightwiseness, and hatedest wickedness; therefore the God, thy God, anointed thee with oil of joy [therefore God, thy God, anointed thee with oil of gladness, or joy], more than thy fellows.
10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning foundedest the earth, and heavens be works of thine hands;
11	they shall perish, but thou shalt perfectly dwell; and all shall wax old as a cloak [as a cloth],
12	and thou shalt change them as a cloak [as a cloth], and they shall be changed.  But thou art the same thyself, and thy years shall not fail.
13	But to which of the angels said God at any time, Sit thou on my right half, till I put thine enemies a stool of thy feet?
14	Whether they all be not serving spirits, sent to serve for them [sent into ministry for them] that take the heritage of health?
