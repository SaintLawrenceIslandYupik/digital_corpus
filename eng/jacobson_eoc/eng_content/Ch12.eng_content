I am eating the meat aspic only.
Why are you reading laying on your back on the floor.
The old woman sewing a parka is in her childâ€™s house.
The mad man said the dried walrus skin he was going to use is bad.
My son said the king polar bear ate the spotted seals.
I will buy the vehicle that is upside down.
The fresh ice is in the box.
Your red parka is here.
My mother sewed alone.
The boys are swimming together with their clothes off.
The woman that is mad can eat sea apples.
