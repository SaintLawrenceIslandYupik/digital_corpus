A mouse ate crowberries.
The boots are lost.
We went on a long trip.
They seen sea peaches.
The rabbit became afraid of foxes.
The white person arried from Savoonga.
The guests danced.
The belt is long
You all ate sea lion.
The orphan came from the lake.
The two girls coughed.
They cooked sculpin.
The dogs heard owls.
I slept.
The children went out of the house.
