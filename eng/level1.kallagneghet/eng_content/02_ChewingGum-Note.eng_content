Eskimo chewing gum was made in the springtime when there were still patches of snow on the ground.
The burned oil that dripped from the seal-oil lamp went into an overflow container.
This oil was put in a fireproof container.
The container was buried rim-high in the ground or gravel near the snow and a fire was built around it.
As the oil caught fire, it was left burning until it burned itself out.
Then it was dumped on the snow to cool it.
