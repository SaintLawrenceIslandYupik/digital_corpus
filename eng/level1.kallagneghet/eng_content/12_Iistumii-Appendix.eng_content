The woman had taken all the mouse food, leaving nothing for the mice during the winter.
She felt very guilty.
But Old Man Mouse said, “It’s OK.
She’s somebody’s child, too.”
In that way he forgave her and reminded her not to leave the mice without food again.
Then her husband showed her more respect because she had learned to be compassionate.
