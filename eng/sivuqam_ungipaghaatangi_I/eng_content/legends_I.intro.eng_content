There are many tales told by Eskimo people.
They were known by telling for ages because the Eskimo language was not written.
Now many of these stories are being written and published.

The ability to read and write is a great treasure to the Eskimo people.
It is possible to record the history of our people for all the generations to come.
Many thanks to the schools and to the teachers who have given us this gift of learning.
