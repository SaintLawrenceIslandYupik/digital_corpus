Around St. Lawrence Island it is said that the Arctic Terns are the last of the migratory birds to arrive in late spring and first to leave in late summer.
These colorful birds lay their eggs on sand beach banks and even on footprints on the gravel.
These little birds would fly off from their nests and dive down at people who are walking along the shore banks to keep them away from their nests.
