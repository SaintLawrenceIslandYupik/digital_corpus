## ABOUT

The `xml` directory contains an xml file for each document in Kayo Nagai's 2001 book *Mrs. Della Waghiyi's St. Lawrence Island Yupik Texts with Grammatical Analysis*. Each file was generated by converting Dr. Nagai's original Word document of sentences and interlinear glosses to xml.

The `human_verified` directory contains a txt file of interlinear glosses for each document in the book. These were generated by OCR-ing the relevant pages from the book and manually formatting the OCR'd text such that each sentence was paired with its interlinear gloss. The sentences and glosses were later manually verified by a volunteer.

## TODO

The glosses that appear in the xml files need to be cross-checked with the human-verified glosses.
